# Project Goal
Imagine you have an interacting agents acting like a finite-state-machines.

This library will help you to calculate the specific traits (features) of each agent.

With the quantitative and/or categorical features, describing the showing activity of the agent, you'll be able to:
* classify each agent
* predict agent's next action on specific spot
# The Advantages
* strict type-safe enumeration-based abstractions
# Where the Library Would Be Helpful
* commercial (card) games
* intelligence
* online-bot detection
* data preparation
# Motivation and Project Status
Just for fun, to be improved
